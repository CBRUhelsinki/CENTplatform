	abstract = {Reduced seizure incidence coupled with voluntary motor inhibition accompanied conditioned increases in the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR), a 12- 14 Hz rhythm appearing over rolandic cortex. Although SMR biofeedback training has been successfully applied to various forms of epilepsy in humans, its potential use in decreasing hyperactivity has been limited to a few cases in which a seizure history was also a significant feature. The present study represents a first attempt to explore the technique's applicability to the problem of hyperkinesis independent of the epilepsy issue. The results of several months of EEG biofeedback training in a hyperkinetic child tend to corroborate and extend previous findings. Feedback presentations for SMR were contingent on the production of 12- 14-Hz activity in the absence of 4- 7-Hz slow-wave activity. A substantial increase in SMR motor inhibition, as gauged by laboratory measures of muscular tone (chin EMG) and by a global behavioral assessment in the classroom. Opposite trends in motor inhibition occurred when the training procedure was reversed and feedback presentations were contingent on the production of 4- 7 Hz in the absence of 12- 14-Hz activity. Although the preliminary nature of these results is stressed, the subject population has recently been increased to establish the validity and generality of the findings and will include the use of SMR biofeedback training after medication has been withdrawn.},

@article{Vernon2003,
	abstract = {The use of neurofeedback as an operant conditioning paradigm has disclosed that participants are able to gain some control over particular aspects of their electroencephalogram (EEG). Based on the association between theta activity (4–7 Hz) and working memory performance, and sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) activity (12–15 Hz) and attentional processing, we investigated the possibility that training healthy individuals to enhance either of these frequencies would specifically influence a particular aspect of cognitive performance, relative to a non-neurofeedback control-group. The results revealed that after eight sessions of neurofeedback the SMR-group were able to selectively enhance their SMR activity, as indexed by increased SMR/theta and SMR/beta ratios. In contrast, those trained to selectively enhance theta activity failed to exhibit any changes in their EEG. Furthermore, the SMR-group exhibited a significant and clear improvement in cued recall performance, using a semantic working memory task, and to a lesser extent showed improved accuracy of focused attentional processing using a 2-sequence continuous performance task. This suggests that normal healthy individuals can learn to increase a specific component of their EEG activity, and that such enhanced activity may facilitate semantic processing in a working memory task and to a lesser extent focused attention. We discuss possible mechanisms that could mediate such effects and indicate a number of directions for future research.},

	abstract = {In children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), different neurofeedback (NF) protocols have been applied, with the most prominent differentiation between EEG frequency-band (e.g., theta/beta) training and training of slow cortical potentials (SCPs). However, beyond distinctions between such basic NF variables, there are also competing assumptions about mechanisms of action (e.g., acquisition of regulation capability, generalization to daily life behavior). In the present article, we provide a framework for NF models and suppose two hypothetical models, which we call "conditioning-and-repairing model" and "skill-acquisition model," reflecting extreme poles within this framework. We argue that the underlying model has an impact not only on how NF is applied but also on the selection of evaluation strategies and suggest using evaluation strategies beyond beaten paths of pharmacological research. Reflecting available studies, we address to what extent different views are supported by empirical data. We hypothesize that different models may hold true depending on the processes and behaviors to be addressed by a certain NF protocol. For example, the skill-acquisition model is supported by recent findings as an adequate explanatory framework for the mechanisms of action of SCP training in ADHD. In conclusion, evaluation and interpretation of NF trials in ADHD should be based on the underlying model and the way training is applied, which, in turn, should be stated explicitly in study reports.},

	abstract = {Recent studies suggest a role for sleep and sleep problems in the etiology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and a recent model about the working mechanism of sensori-motor rhythm (SMR) neurofeedback, proposed that this intervention normalizes sleep and thus improves ADHD symptoms such as inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. In this study we compared adult ADHD patients (N = 19) to a control group (N = 28) and investigated if differences existed in sleep parameters such as Sleep Onset Latency (SOL), Sleep Duration (DUR) and overall reported sleep problems (PSQI) and if there is an association between sleep-parameters and ADHD symptoms. Secondly, in 37 ADHD patients we investigated the effects of SMR and Theta/Beta (TBR) neurofeedback on ADHD symptoms and sleep parameters and if these sleep parameters may mediate treatment outcome to SMR and TBR neurofeedback. In this study we found a clear continuous relationship between self-reported sleep problems (PSQI) and inattention in adults with- and without-ADHD. TBR neurofeedback resulted in a small reduction of SOL, this change in SOL did not correlate with the change in ADHD symptoms and the reduction in SOL only happened in the last half of treatment, suggesting this is an effect of symptom improvement not specifically related to TBR neurofeedback. SMR neurofeedback specifically reduced the SOL and PSQI score, and the change in SOL and change in PSQI correlated strongly with the change in inattention, and the reduction in SOL was achieved in the first half of treatment, suggesting the reduction in SOL mediated treatment response to SMR neurofeedback. Clinically, TBR and SMR neurofeedback had similar effects on symptom reduction in ADHD (inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity). These results suggest differential effects and different working mechanisms for TBR and SMR neurofeedback in the treatment of ADHD.},

@article{Mayer2015,
	abstract = {In children and adults with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a general slowing of spontaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) brain activity and a decrease of event-related potential amplitudes such as the contingent negative variation (CNV) are observed. Additionally, some studies have reported decreased skin conductance level (SCL) in this clinical population leading to the hypothesis of a peripheral hypoarousal, which may be a target of biofeedback treatment in addition to or instead of neurofeedback. To our knowledge, the relationship between SCL and CNV has not been simultaneously investigated in one experiment. Using the theoretical background of the hypoarousal model, this article aims to gain more insight into the differences and correlations of cortical (CNV) and peripheral (SCL) arousal in adults with ADHD. A sample of 23 adults with ADHD and 22 healthy controls underwent an auditory Go-NoGo task with simultaneous 22-channel EEG and SCL recordings. Reaction time (RT) and reaction time variability (RTV) were also measured to assess task performance. Significantly decreased CNV amplitude and significantly higher RTV were observed in the ADHD group, reflecting cortical underarousal and problems with sustained attention. No significant correlation between peripheral underarousal and cortical underarousal was observed in the ADHD group or the control group. The observed cortical underarousal reflected in the decreased CNV supports the notion of a reduced CNV amplitude as a possible biomarker for ADHD. However, the connection between cortical and peripheral arousal is not as clear as is suggested in previous research investigating both separately. Implications of these results for new treatment options for ADHD such as biofeedback are discussed.},

	abstract = {Very diverse assessment procedures are utilized by neurofeedback practitioners, many of which are not based on careful examination of raw EEG data followed by scientifically objective quantitative EEG (QEEG) database comparisons. Research is reviewed demonstrating the great heterogeneity in the EEG patterns associated with various diagnoses and symptoms. The fact that most patients qualify for dual diagnoses, with co-morbid psychiatric and medical conditions present, complicates the ability of clinicians to estimate what electrophysiological patterns may be associated with symptoms. In such cases treatment planning is characterized by a great deal of guesswork and experimentation. Peer reviewed publications have documented that neurofeedback treatment can sometimes be associated with both transient side effects as well as more serious negative effects. It is believed that the lack of comprehensive and objective assessment of brain functioning may increase the risk of neurofeedback either being ineffective or causing iatrogenic harm. QEEG provides reliable, non-invasive, objective, culture-free and relatively low cost evaluation of brain functioning, permitting individualization of treatment and added liability protection.},

	abstract = {We propose development of evidence-based methods to guide clinical intervention in neurobehavioral syndromes based on categorization of individuals using both behavioral measures and quantification of the EEG (qEEG). Review of a large number of clinical EEG and qEEG studies suggests that it is plausible to identify a limited set of individual profiles that characterize the majority of the population. Statistical analysis has already been used to document "clusters" of qEEG features seen in populations of psychiatric patients. These clusters are considered here as intermediate phenotypes, based on genetics, and are reliable indices of brain function, not isomorphic with DSM categories, and carry implications for therapeutic intervention. We call for statistical analysis methods to be applied to a broad clinical database of individuals diagnosed with neurobehavioral disorders in order to empirically define clusters of individuals who may be responsive to specific neurophysiologically based treatment interventions, namely administration of psychoactive medication and/or EEG neurofeedback. A tentative set of qEEG profiles is proposed based on clinical observation and experience. Implication for intervention with medication and neurofeedback for individuals with these neurophysiological profiles and specific qEEG patterns is presented.},
