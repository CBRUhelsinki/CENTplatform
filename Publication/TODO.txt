CENT publishing plan


Step 1.
Literature review of similar software[a] and needs. JT
        See CENTplatform.tex below for initial links...


Step 2.
Split extra applications to a separate independent Github-repo. Keep only core-CENT files in the CBRU-repo. JT


Step 3.
Rationalization of the documentation AKA how to build/use the thing (no code documentation). Update documentation regarding plugins accordingly (see step 2). TI, BC


Step 4.
Draft a draft and look for fundings. BC


Step 5.
Add MIT license boilerplate to the code - or licence from the repo root? TI


Step 6.
Write the manuscript + validation. JT, TI, BC
See below for draft beginnings.


Step 7.
Publish 




CODE CLEANUP DETAILS
Core repo should serve 4 functions:
1. Install CENT, from CENTPackage (with documentation)
2. Build (with build instructions from documentation - notice that extended documentation ...)
3. View sources
4. Extend: plugins, OV scenarios, new menu functions (e.g. call some external exe)


Detailed, ordered clean up (tentative, subject to Teemu’s build experience):
1. CENTExtra: move ‘IAF Calculator…’, ‘Patient History…’ to new repo - JT
2. Mapping Tool (let’s check this only after rebuild) - BC
   a. CENTPackage: move .exe / .dll package at ./PatientAnonymisationMappingTool
   b. (tentative!) CENTSources move: 
      i. ./cent/CENTSystem/MappingTool
      ii. ./cent/Documentation/MappingTool
      iii. ./cent/CENTSystem/build/buildMappingToolPackage.bat
   c. cut Mapping Tool from core documentation 
      i. (what about obfuscated platform output? Maybe it is not relevant to the core package, i.e. core package only serves to perform NFB, not to also analyse patient history)
   d. create package from sources and .exe / .dll package
3. Documentation - TI
   a. CENTSystemDocumentation: move CENTSystemExtendedDocumentation
   b. CENTUsage: move everything
   c. In extra-stuff repo, create extended documentation covering all
      i. extra programs/packages:
         -. ‘IAF Calculator…’
         -. ‘Patient History…’
         -. MappingTool
      ii. usage: ‘TechnicalChecklist’, Appendix I and II
   d. Notice that core docs will have to be edited, to 
      i. remove reference to HY and BLStream
      ii. include better build instructions from extended documentation(?)
   e. Extended documentation clean-up (preliminary):
      i. section 1.6
      ii. section 2.4.1 Astrocomet game
      iii. check Appendix A
      iv. check Appendix B
      v. delete Appendix C?
