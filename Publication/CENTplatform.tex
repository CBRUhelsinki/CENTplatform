%TODO temporary short abstract...update after writing
Biofeedback/neurofeedback is a growing clinical field. Tools for administering feedback treatment tend to be proprietary and fixed/non-extensible. Thus there is a need for a biofeedback platform which is entirely open source, extensible and free. We present the Computer Enabled Neuroplasticity Treatment (CENT) platform to meet this need.

Story/structure is:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Introduction + motivation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item we needed a NFB platform and didn’t find anything suitable (why not?)
		\item we developed CENT platform at the same time as setting up the clinical trial
		\item we aimed for lots of good things: modular, extensible, state of the art technology, effective but simple UI, minimal but extensible feature set
		\item other systems exist but CENT fills a niche because...
	\end{itemize}

	\item Related work
	\begin{itemize}

\section{Introduction}

% some motivation
Neurofeedback/Biofeedback (NFB) is a growing field, with extensive clinical use, a large body of research literature, and applications also in performance enhancement, entertainment, and stress relief. 

Tools for administering feedback treatment tend to be proprietary and fixed/non-extensible. Thus there is a need for a biofeedback platform which is entirely open source, extensible and free. We present the Computer Enabled Neuroplasticity Treatment (CENT) platform to meet this need.

The CENT platform was developed to facilitate the CENT clinical trial of NFB treatment for adult ADHD, conducted at the University of Helsinki, Finland (REF). 


% specifics: CENT platform. Advantages
\todo[inline]{specifics: CENT platform. Advantages}
The CENT platform was designed to connect light-weight EEG amplifiers to a simple, easy-to-use interface for running NFB sessions. The platform's workflow is fixed but adaptable, with configurable settings for personalisation of the treatment.

\subsection*{Some \LaTeX{} Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

Use section and subsection commands to organize your document. \LaTeX{} handles all the formatting and numbering automatically. Use ref and label commands for cross-references.

\subsection*{Figures and Tables}

Use the table and tabular commands for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example. You can upload a figure (JPEG, PNG or PDF) using the project menu. To include it in your document, use the includegraphics command.

\begin{table}[ht]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l|r}
		Item & Quantity \\\hline
		Widgets & 42 \\
		Gadgets & 13
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Citations}

LaTeX formats citations and references automatically using the bibliography records in your .bib file, which you can edit via the project menu. Use the cite command for an inline citation, like \cite{Figueredo:2009dg}, and the citep command for a citation in parentheses \citep{Figueredo:2009dg}.

\subsection*{Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
$$S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i$$
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

\subsection*{Lists}

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep] 
	\item Like this,
	\item and like this.
\end{enumerate}
\dots or bullet points \dots
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep] 
	\item Like this,
	\item and like this.
\end{itemize}
\dots or with words and descriptions \dots
\begin{description}
	\item[Word] Definition
	\item[Concept] Explanation
	\item[Idea] Text
\end{description}

We hope you find write\LaTeX\ useful for your PeerJ submission, and please let us know if you have any feedback. Further examples with dummy text are included in the following pages.
